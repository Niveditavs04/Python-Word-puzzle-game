Abstract : "WordWiz: Python word jumble game"
The Python Tkinter Word Jumble Game is an interactive and
educational game that challenges players to unscramble jumbled words. The game
features a user-friendly graphical interface created using the Tkinter library, offering a visually engaging
and intuitive user experience.

Players are presented with a series of words that have been scrambled,
and they must decipher the correct word.
To enhance the gaming experience, a progress bar is integrated into the
interface using the ttk module,
giving players a visual indication of their advancement through the
game.

In addition to its gameplay elements, the project leverages the SQLite3
database to store player scores, providing a competitive element to the game. Scores are tracked and
recorded, allowing users to track their performance over time.

This project serves as an excellent introduction to Python programming,
GUI design with Tkinter, and working with databases
using SQLite3. It combines educational value with user engagement,
making it an enjoyable and instructive project for both developers and players.
